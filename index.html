    <h1> ALICE FANG </h1>
    <h2> COMPUTER SCIENTIST </h2>
    <h3> UIUC CLASS OF 2021 </h3>
    <p class = "intro"> Hello World! My name
      is Alice Fang and I'm a freshman at the
      University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.
      I'm a computer science major and plan to minor
      in statistics. At UIUC, I'm
      currently taking CS 125 (the best class ever)
      and CS 196, where I'm working on a project
      called BattleToadsDash.
    </p>
    <p class = "intro">
      Some topics in CS that I'm interested in
      are data science and
      software development, and I'm
      hoping to gain more experience in these fields at my
      time here at UIUC. One of my future aspirations is to
      work at Facebook, but I just started programming this
      year so I have a long way to go.
    </p>
    <p class = "intro">
      When I'm not sleeping or studying, you can catch me
      dancing with the Asian American
      Association (AAA), or participating in Women in
      Computer Science (WCS) events. Or at CS 125 office hours.
      Or just anywhere in Siebel basically.
